    <h1 style="color: firebrick">Some of their stories</h1>
   <p><ol>
   <li>Ravana, in Hinduism, the 10-headed king of the demons. His abduction of Sita and eventual defeat by her husband Rama are the central incidents of the popular epic the Ramayana. Ravana ruled in the kingdom of Lanka, from which he had expelled his brother Kubera. The Ram Lila festival, an annual pageant popular particularly in northern India, is climaxed with the defeat of Ravana and the burning of huge effigies of the demons.
 <li>A Rakshasa (female Rakshasi) is a bloodthirsty demon, banished from the realm of the gods and forced to live on earth, making mankind its prey. While most of the beasts are as evil as evil can be, a few of them have formed alliances with noble armies and performed heroic feats in battle.
 <li>Hanuman, in Hindu mythology, the monkey commander of the monkey army. His exploits are narrated in the great Hindu Sanskrit poem the Ramayana (“Rama’s Journey”)
 <li>One of the popular Indian mythological stories is Eklavya. His aspiration to learn archery and become one of the finest archers of the time is truly inspirational. Despite the rejection by Guru Dronacharya, Eklavya mastered the skill of archery on his own. He practiced tirelessly in front of a statue of his teacher. His act of offering his thumb to his Guru as Dakshina labeled him as an ideal disciple</li>
 <li>Devas (sometimes translated as Gods) and the Asuras (sometimes translated as demons) heard that they could gain the nectar of immortality if they churned the great ocean of milk. They used a giant serpent and a mountain to churn and uncovered many things (sort of like Pandora’s box). In some versions an avatar of Vishnu stabilizes the mountain they are using to churn. During the churning one thing that is released is a poison that would destroy the world. Shiva rushes in and sucks the poison into his mouth and his wife Parvati runs over to hold his throat and preventing the poison from going down into his stomach, giving him a blue throat. In the end the Asuras are tricked by Vishnu out of getting the nectar.  In some versions Brahma is guiding this process </Li>
 <li>The basic story is that Parvati was lonely while her husband Shiva was away (he was often practicing asceticism in the mountains and meditating for days at a time).  She madea child for herself by fashioning him out of clay and breathing life into him. She set her new son to guard the door while she bathed and told him to let no one in.
When Shiva returned and tried to go to his wife, he was stopped by a little boy he had never seen before. Enraged when the child would not let him pass, he cut off the boy’s head.
Parvati saw her dead child and wept inconsolably until Shiva set out to fix the situation. The very first animal he came to, an elephant, he cut off its head and attached it to the body of the boy. He was brought back to life and became Ganesha, son of Parvati and Shiva.</li>
